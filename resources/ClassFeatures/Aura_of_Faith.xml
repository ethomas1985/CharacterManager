  <Body>&lt;p id="aura-of-faith-21"&gt;At 14th level, a paladin's weapons are treated as good-aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. Any attack made against an enemy within 10 feet of her is treated as good-aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This ability functions only while the paladin is conscious, not if she is unconscious or dead.&lt;/p&gt;</Body>
