  <Name>Holy Champion</Name>
  <Body>&lt;p id="holy-champion"&gt;At 20th level, a paladin becomes a conduit for the power of her god. Her DR increases to 10/evil. Whenever she uses smite evil and successfully strikes an evil outsider, the outsider is also subject to a &lt;i&gt;banishment&lt;/i&gt;, using her paladin level as the caster level (her weapon and holy symbol automatically count as objects that the subject hates). After the &lt;i&gt;banishment&lt;/i&gt; effect and the damage from the attack is resolved, the smite immediately ends. In addition, whenever she channels positive energy or uses lay on hands to heal a creature, she heals the maximum possible amount.&lt;/p&gt;</Body>
