  <Name>Uncanny Dodge</Name>
  <Body>&lt;p id="uncanny-dodge-rogue"&gt;Starting at 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action (see Combat) against her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.&lt;/p&gt;</Body>
