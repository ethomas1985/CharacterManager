  <Name>Cantrips</Name>
  <Body>&lt;p id="cantrips-wizard"&gt; Wizards can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table: Wizard under &amp;ldquo;Spells per Day.&amp;rdquo; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. A wizard can prepare a cantrip from a prohibited school, but it uses up two of his available slots (see below).&lt;/p&gt;</Body>
