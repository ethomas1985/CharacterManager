  <Check>&lt;h1&gt;Check&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DC and effect of a Heal check depend on the task you attempt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Task&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Task&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;DC&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;&lt;td&gt;First aid&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class="even"&gt;&lt;td&gt;Long-term care&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;&lt;td&gt;Treat wounds from caltrops, &lt;i&gt;spike growth&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;spike stones&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class="even"&gt;&lt;td&gt;Treat deadly wounds&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;20&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;&lt;td&gt;Treat poison&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Poison's save DC&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class="even"&gt;&lt;td&gt;Treat disease&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Disease's save DC&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h1&gt;First Aid&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p id="first-aid"&gt;You usually use first aid to save a dying character. If a character has negative hit points and is losing hit points (at the rate of 1 per round, 1 per hour, or 1 per day), you can make him stable. A stable character regains no hit points but stops losing them. First aid also stops a character from losing hit points due to effects that cause bleed (see Conditions for rules on bleed damage).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Long-Term Care&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p id="long-term-care"&gt;Providing long-term care means treating a wounded person for a day or more. If your Heal check is successful, the patient recovers hit points or ability score points lost to ability damage at twice the normal rate: 2 hit points per level for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 hit points per level for each full day of complete rest; 2 ability score points for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 ability score points for each full day of complete rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can tend to as many as six patients at a time. You need a few items and supplies (bandages, salves, and so on) that are easy to come by in settled lands. Giving long-term care counts as light activity for the healer. You cannot give long-term care to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Treat Wounds from Caltrops, Spike Growth, or Spike Stones&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;A creature wounded by stepping on a caltrop moves at half normal speed. A successful Heal check removes this movement penalty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A creature wounded by a &lt;i&gt;spike growth&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;spike stones&lt;/i&gt; spell must succeed on a Reflex save or take injuries that reduce his speed by one-third. Another character can remove this penalty by taking 10 minutes to dress the victim's injuries and succeeding on a Heal check against the spell's save DC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Treat Deadly Wounds&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p id="treat-deadly-wounds"&gt;When treating deadly wounds, you can restore hit points to a damaged creature. Treating deadly wounds restores 1 hit point per level of the creature. If you exceed the DC by 5 or more, add your Wisdom modifier (if positive) to this amount. A creature can only benefit from its deadly wounds being treated within 24 hours of being injured and never more than once per day. You must expend two uses from a healer's kit to perform this task. You take a &amp;ndash;2 penalty on your Heal skill check for each use from the healer's kit that you lack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Treat Poison&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p id="treat-poison"&gt;To treat poison means to tend to a single character who has been poisoned and who is going to take more damage from the poison (or suffer some other effect). Every time the poisoned character makes a saving throw against the poison, you make a Heal check. If your Heal check exceeds the DC of the poison, the character receives a +4 competence bonus on his saving throw against the poison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Treat Disease&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p id="treat-disease"&gt;To treat a disease means to tend to a single diseased character. Every time the diseased character makes a saving throw against disease effects, you make a Heal check. If your Heal check exceeds the DC of the disease, the character receives a +4 competence bonus on his saving throw against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;</Check>
  <Action>&lt;p&gt;Providing first aid, treating a wound, or treating poison is a standard action. Treating a disease or tending a creature wounded by a &lt;i&gt;spike growth&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;spike stones&lt;/i&gt; spell takes 10 minutes of work. Treating deadly wounds takes 1 hour of work. Providing long-term care requires 8 hours of light activity.&lt;/p&gt;</Action>
  <TryAgain>&lt;p&gt;Varies. Generally speaking, you can't try a Heal check again without witnessing proof of the original check's failure. You can always retry a check to provide first aid, assuming the target of the previous attempt is still alive.&lt;/p&gt;</TryAgain>
  <Special>&lt;p&gt;A character with the Self-Sufficient feat gets a bonus on Heal checks (see Feats).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A healer's kit gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Heal checks.&lt;/p&gt;</Special>
