  <Description>&lt;p id="iron-cold"&gt;This iron, mined deep underground and known for its effectiveness against demons and fey creatures, is forged at a lower temperature to preserve its delicate properties. Weapons made of cold iron cost twice as much to make as their normal counterparts. Also, adding any magical enhancements to a cold iron weapon increases its price by 2,000 gp. This increase is applied the first time the item is enhanced, not once per ability added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Items without metal parts cannot be made from cold iron. An arrow could be made of cold iron, but a quarterstaff could not. A double weapon with one cold iron half costs 50% more than normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold iron has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>
