  <Description>&lt;p&gt;A crossbow bolt used as a melee weapon is treated as a light improvised weapon (&amp;ndash;4 penalty on attack rolls) and deals damage as a dagger of its size (crit &amp;times;2). Bolts come in a case or quiver that holds 10 bolts (or 5, for a repeating crossbow). &lt;/p&gt;</Description>
