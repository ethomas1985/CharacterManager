  <Description>&lt;p&gt;This one-handed axe is short (roughly 1 foot long) and designed for use with one hand. Unlike throwing axes, it is not well balanced for a graceful tumbling motion, and is instead heavier at its head. Tomahawks, war hatchets, and other such names usually refer to hand axes.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>
