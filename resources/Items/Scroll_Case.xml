  <Description>&lt;p&gt;A leather or wooden scroll case easily holds four scrolls; you can cram more inside, but retrieving any of them becomes a full-round action rather than a move action. You must destroy the scroll case to damage its contents (hardness 2 for leather or 5 for wood, 2 hit points, break DC 15). A scroll case is not watertight, and must still be protected from the elements.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>
