  <Description>&lt;p&gt;This heavy, two-handed hammer is normally used in carpentry and other construction tasks, and is also useful for driving in tent stakes to help secure campsites in areas with strong winds. If used in combat, treat it as an improvised earth breaker (see page 27).&lt;/p&gt;</Description>
