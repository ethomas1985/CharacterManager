  <Description>&lt;p&gt;The handle of this axe is long enough that you can wield it one-handed or two-handed. The head may have one blade or two, with blade shapes ranging from half-moons to squared edges like narrower versions of woodcutting axes. The wooden haft may be protected and strengthened with metal bands called langets.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>
