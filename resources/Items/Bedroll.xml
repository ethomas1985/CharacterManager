  <Description>&lt;p&gt;This consists of two woolen sheets sewn together along the bottom and one side to create a bag for sleeping in. Some have cloth straps along the open side so the bedroll can be tied closed while you are sleeping. It can be rolled and tied into a tight coil for storage or transport. Most people use a blanket with the bedroll to stay warm or provide a ground cushion.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>
