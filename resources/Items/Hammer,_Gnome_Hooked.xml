  <Description>&lt;p&gt;A gnome hooked hammer is a double weapon&amp;mdash;an ingenious tool with a hammer head at one end of its haft and a long, curved pick at the other. The hammer's blunt head is a bludgeoning weapon that deals 1d6 points of damage (crit &amp;times;3). Its hook is a piercing weapon that deals 1d4 points of damage (crit &amp;times;4). You can use either head as the primary weapon. Gnomes treat hooked hammers as martial weapons.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>
