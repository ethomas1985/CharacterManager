  <Description>&lt;p&gt;You can draw a hand crossbow back by hand. Loading a hand crossbow is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can shoot, but not load, a hand crossbow with one hand at no penalty. You can shoot a hand crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two light weapons.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>
