  <Description>&lt;p&gt;With a DC 5 Perform (wind instruments) check, you can use a whistle to signal the same sorts of situations as signal horns. A whistle's piercing report can be clearly heard (Perception DC 0) up to a quarter-mile away. For each quarter-mile beyond, Perception checks to hear a whistle take a &amp;ndash;2 penalty. Silent whistles that only animals and other creatures with keen hearing can hear also exist. &lt;/p&gt;</Description>
