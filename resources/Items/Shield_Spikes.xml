  <Description>&lt;p id="shield-spikes"&gt;These spikes turn a shield into a martial piercing weapon and increase the damage dealt by a shield bash as if the shield were designed for a creature one size category larger than you (see &amp;ldquo;spiked shields&amp;rdquo; on Table: Weapons). You can't put spikes on a buckler or a tower shield. Otherwise, attacking with a spiked shield is like making a shield bash attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An enhancement bonus on a spiked shield does not improve the effectiveness of a shield bash made with it, but a spiked shield can be made into a magic weapon in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>
