  <Description>&lt;p&gt;This larger, bulkier version of the common club is heavy enough that you can't wield it with one hand. It may be ornate and carved, reinforced with metal, or a simple branch from a tree. Like simple clubs, greatclubs have many names, such as cudgels, bludgeons, shillelaghs, and more.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>
