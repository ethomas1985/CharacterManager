  <Description>&lt;p&gt;A horse is suitable as a mount for a human, dwarf, elf, half-elf, or half-orc. A pony is smaller than a horse and is a suitable mount for a gnome or halfling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A war-trained horse can be ridden into combat without danger. See the Handle Animal skill for a list of tricks known by horses and ponies with combat training.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>
