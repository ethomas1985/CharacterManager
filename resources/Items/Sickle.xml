  <Description>&lt;p&gt;Originating as a farming tool used for reaping grain, this one-handed weapon has a blade with a strong curve that can easily catch an opponent's limb or armor. Its blade can be either smooth or serrated, and some fighting sickles are sharpened on both sides near the point, making it easier to hook into an opponent's flesh.&lt;/p&gt;</Description>
